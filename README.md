# IMU Calibration for Arduino

## Overview

This Arduino project is designed to calibrate an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) based on the procedure outlined in a [calibration video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=your-video-id). The code is intended to be used with an Arduino board and is developed using Arduino IDE version 1.18.19.

### Calibration Tag

The `Calibration` tag represents the first version of the calibration code used in the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE 1.18.19
- Arduino Board
- Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
- Calibration video link: [IMU Calibration Video](https://youtu.be/-1tmYPE7MAQ?si=UWM-_kh0ASn7Dxq6)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/calibration-repo.git

   Open the Arduino IDE and load the project.

2. Configure the Arduino IDE for your specific Arduino board and install any required libraries.

3. Connect the IMU to the Arduino board following the provided pin configurations.

### Calibration Procedure

1. Watch the IMU Calibration Video for the step-by-step calibration process.

2. Open the Arduino IDE and upload the Calibration version of the code to the Arduino board.

3. Follow the calibration steps as outlined in the video.

4. Monitor the serial console for calibration feedback and instructions.
